# STM32_Platform
This repository provides a modular, extensible communication and control platform for STM32 microcontrollers, abstracting peripheral interactions (CAN, UART, SPI, ADC, and timers) into a unified software architecture. The platform leverages HAL drivers and DMA for efficient data handling and flexible callback mechanisms and message queues.
